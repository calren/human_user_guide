# Human User Guide for Caren

This is a living document that represents what I value and how it translates into our great work, together.  Inspired by https://github.com/matthewmccullough/human-interaction-templates/blob/master/examples/human-user-guide-for-matthew.md

## What matters most to Caren?

- Respectfulness. I appreciate people who respect other people's time, energy and skillset. I don't like it when people are late, cancel meetings with short notice, schedule early/late meetings with no given reason, or disregard what I can offer.
- Purpose. If I don't see the purpose of a task or a meeting, I'm more demotivated.

## What communication patterns are most attractive to you?

- Email. Emails are more indexable than chat, and I've always felt there's more thought put into emails than chat messages. Sometimes I'll be drafting an email and then realize this really doesn't need to be brought up right now.
- A quick TLDR or one sentence summary that precedes a long email / chat message.

## Rituals

- I walk my dog three times a day when I work from home, so it's hard to take early morning / late evening meetings because my dog will probably be complaining in the background during said meeting.
- I like going on runs when I don't have meetings in the middle of the day to avoid taking naps or drinking more coffee. 

## What drives you nuts?

- Chat messages that start only with 'hello' / 'hi'. It's more helpful to also include the purpose of your message.
- Meetings that get cancelled last minute. (Because if I had a good chunk of non-meeting block, I could have planned the day a bit differently.)
- Meetings without agendas. (I'm not the best at thinking on the spot, so I like to digest and think about things before a meeting, otherwise I'll have nothing useful to contribute during the meeting.)
- People who don't do what they say they'll do, or tell everybody at the last minute that something is not on schedule. It's hard to estimate how much work can be accomplished in a certain time frame, but it's easy to give better expectations about timelines as time progresses. 

## What are your quirks?

- I may use too many unnecessary exclamation marks or emojis in chats and emails. Mostly because I feel like my tone is too serious if I don't use them.

## How can people earn an extra gold star with you?

- 

## What are some of your long-time mantras?

-

## What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?

- 

## Whatâ€™s the best way to communicate with you?

- Email. Chat messages make me feel a bit anxious because I feel like I need to respond immediately. 

## How do you like to get feedback?

- Immediately. If there's feedback to be given about a particular situation, I would appreciate if it was given immediately after said situatiion. If you bring it up 2 weeks or 3 months from the situation, I'll be wondering why you're bringing it up much later.
- Through chat / email. I'm not good at immediately digesting feedback, and may come off a bit defensive. But if I have some time to digest the feedback by myself, I'm usually able to address the feedback much better.

## Resources, Inspirations

- My favorite quote: "People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you make them feel." - Maya Angelou
- [The Broken Ladder](https://www.amazon.com/Broken-Ladder-Inequality-Affects-Think/dp/0525429816) is one of the books that most heavily influenced how I think about certain things.
